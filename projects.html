    <h1>Research</h1>
    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p><b>I'm interested in...</b><br />
        <ul>
          <li>understanding language<br />
            <small>what drives the evolution of form?<br />
             how can we capture representation of meaning?</small></li>
          <li> modeling language using computers<br />
            <small>what are the current capabilities of language modeling tools?<br />
              how can we evaluate them in comparison with human language perception? <br />
              what can computational models tell us about human language evolution?<br /></small></li>
          <li> designing language technology<br /><small>
            how can we improve current language processing methods to work for low-resource settings and non-conventional communication?
            <br /> at the social level, how can we actually employ language technology to reduce communication barriers?</small></li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p><b>Studying individual neuron responses to speech</b></p>
    <p>Current questions: Can artificial neural network encodings model brain responses to speech? What aspects of the ANNs contribute to modeling ability? How is the neural encoding of speech information distributed?</p>
    <p><a href="https://2024.ccneuro.org/pdf/408_Paper_authored_CCN_2024_NP_Context-3.pdf">CCN Conference Abstract</a></p><br />
    <p>Future questions: What is the role of probabilistic computations in speech processing, and how do they manifest at the neural level? How does information flow through the brain networks that process speech and language? How do neural circuits distinguish speech from background sound, comprehensible speech from incomprehensible speech, and so on? C</p>
   
    <h2>Past</h2>
    <p><b>Translating English instructions into temporal logic</b></p>
    <p>Robotic planning algorithms let robots find optimal & safe ways to solve formally defined tasks. However, formally defining a task requires domain-specific knowledge and may be inaccessible to the people actually using the robot. In this project, we tried using NLP models to fill in the <i>translation</i> gap between a colloquially described task and a formal logic description.</p>

    <h1>Other</h1>
    <h2>Current</h2>
    <p><b>Rowing</b></p>
    <p>Currently a coxswain for the Pacific Rowing Club Masters.</p>
    <p>In the past, coxed for the MIT Rowing Club (2023) and rowed with the MIT Lightweight Women (2021-2023).</p><br>
    <p><b>Making problem sets for high school linguistics contests</b></p>
    <p>Currently (2023-2025) leading the problem committee for the <a href="https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in/plo/">Panini (Indian National) Linguistics Olympiad.</a> Previously (2019-2021), led the international jury for the <a href="https://aplo.asia/">Asia-Pacific Linguistics Olympiad</a>. We try to design fun and challenging logic puzzles that introduce students to the intricate ways a language can work! See above links to register (or for funsies).</p><br>

      <li><a href="https://tarjim.ly/en">Tarjimly</a>: on-demand interpretation for refugees<br />
         <small>If you are multilingual, you can volunteer anytime to translate for refugees, using just a smartphone app</small></li>
      <li><a href="https://esp.mit.edu">MIT Educational Studies Program</a><br />
        <small> Teach Anything to middle-school or high-school students at one of these annual MIT-student-run programs. <br />
          If you're not located near MIT, check out Learning Unlimited for similar programs or to start your own chapter.</small></li>
