      <h3> About </h3>
      <p> When I turned 21, I had spent exactly half my life in India and half in the US (neither continuously.) I'm slightly older now, and I live in Cambridge (MA), so... it's a delicate balance. When I think of home, I usually think of Pune, and of hills, traffic, and मिसळ!!!! But sometimes when I think of home, I think of Cambridge, and of the river, of colorful murals, and the energetic hustle of the universities nearby.</p>

      <p> I love trying to do things that I don't really believe I can do. I do not like doing things that I don't want to do. However my bar for wanting to do something is not terribly high. Two truths and a lie: my sleep schedule is unreasonably precious to me, my Spotify Wrapped '22 features 22 languages, and I'm actually so bad at lying I just don't try.</p>
